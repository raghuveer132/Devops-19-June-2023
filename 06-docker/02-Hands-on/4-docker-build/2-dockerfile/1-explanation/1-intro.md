# Here we can see how to build application and create image through docker file

# Advantage of docker file method
* simply a text-based script that is used to create a container image
* clean, compact and repeatable
* easier lifecycle management
* enables automation

# Docker file standards
* create a file named `dockerfile` under any desired folder
* please ensure `dockerfile` has no file extension like `.txt`
* some editors may append this file extension automatically and this would result in an error

# What exactly dockerfile does
* docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from `dockerfile` contains all commands
